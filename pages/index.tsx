          <p>
            I have been building UIs with <strong>React since 2016</strong>. My
            focus is to build what we see on screens. I create and architect
            scalable React component libraries. I like to be part of the design
            process, love working with designers to produce design systems, and
            great screens. I collaborate a lot with other developers to build
            and release components across many products, give direction to the
            front end architecture, support juniors, etc.
          </p>

            Based in Paris, I'm open to remote collaboration. Some random
            interests: plants, climate change, cooking, digital art, exploring
            technologies, documentaries, and rap music.{" "}

            organic food in France. I help them quit Shopify and migrate to
            Next.js. I did front-end architecture, design system, and a lot of
            features to support the development of the company.
