          <p>
            I have been building UIs with <strong>React since 2016</strong>. My
            main work is focused on building UIs, creating component libraries,
            creating design systems, and front-end architecture. I love being
            part of the design process, working with designers to create
            stunning screens, and optimizing the user experience.
          </p>

            Based in Paris, I'm open to remote collaboration. Some random
            interests: plants, climate change, cooking, digital art, exploring
            technologies, documentaries, and rap music.{" "}
