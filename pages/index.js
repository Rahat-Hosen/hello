              I helped them with the exit of shopify by migrating the frontend
              to Next.js. I worked on the front end architecture, design tokens
              and system. I led the work on frontend during the product
              redesign.

          About me â†’
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-2">
          My name is Julien Thibeaut and I currently live in Paris. I code for a
          living, I'm a freelance front-end developer and I love build
          websites/apps with React, React Native and Next.js.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-2">
          I love creating beautiful, interactive user interfaces and designing
          scalable, performant and accessible products.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to the frontend, I like to be part of the design process.
          I love design in the broad sense, for my job I'm interested in user
          interfaces, experiences and design systems.
        </p>

        {/* Willing to work with socially and environmentally responsible organisations ðŸŒŽ */}
        {/* Becoming a developer started out of a need to create - I didn't realize
        it would turn into my career. I love constructing beautiful interfaces
        and architecting applications from the ground-up. I'm primarily focused
        on web development and enjoy working with JavaScript, React, Next.js,
        and Node.js. Outside of development, I'm also interested in design,
        UI/UX, and creating an accessible web for all. I enjoy public speaking
        and mentoring others. On the side, I do freelance
        videography/photography and I'm a wanna-be musician. I'm passionate
        about technology and enjoy staying up to date on all things tech,
        engineering, and business. Feel free to reach out to me any time for
        coffee or just to chat at me@leerob.io. */}
