# Creating shooting star border with Tailwind CSS and CSS

I was looking for a way to create a shooting star border for a project I was working on. I found a few examples online but they were all using SVGs. I wanted to create it using CSS and Tailwind CSS. I was able to create it using a combination of CSS and Tailwind CSS.
