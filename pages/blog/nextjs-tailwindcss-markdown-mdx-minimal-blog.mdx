# Minimal blog with nextjs, tailwindcss and markdown (MDX)

I decided to do a little blog on my personal site. As the first article, this is how I build it.

## Tools

[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) is my favorite tools for making websites.
With a concept of zero configuration, with a lots of features (including hybrid static, server rendering, routing system, etc.) it letting you focus exclusively on your product and building it in a pleasant way.
[Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) is a utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building styles.
[MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) is "Markdown for the component era". MDX let you write JSX in your Markdown documents.

For this article, I will assume you are already familiar with JavaScript and React.

## Project setup

```js live=true
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```

```js
const TestComponent = () => {
  return <div>Test</div>;
};
```

command line pour dev

alternative cms (prismic, etc)

il y a diff√©rentes options pour travailler le mdx avec nextjs. Je vais utiliser pour ma part @next/mdx.
