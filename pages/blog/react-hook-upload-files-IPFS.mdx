# Tiny react hook to upload files into IPFS

For [hellocurator](https://www.hellocurator.xyz/) we want to let users upload an image through our application. The solution of choice for decentralized storing is IPFS.

**IPFS is a distributed system for storing and accessing files, websites, applications, and data.**
I recommend reading the [doc](https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/what-is-ipfs/) if you want to know more about the concepts.

Since our app is written in Next.js, we will use React with a custom hook. But you can take the functionality with any other JavaScript framework.

## The code

We will use the [ipfs-http-client](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/tree/master/packages/ipfs-http-client) library.

```terminal
npm i ipfs-http-client
```

```jsx
import { create } from "ipfs-http-client";
import { ImportCandidate } from "ipfs-core-types/src/utils";

const client = create({ url: "https://ipfs.infura.io:5001/api/v0" });

const useIpfs = () => {
  const upload = async (file: ImportCandidate) => {
    try {
      const added = await client.add(file);
      const url = `https://ipfs.infura.io/ipfs/${added.path}`;

      return url;
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Error uploading file: ", error);
    }
  };

  return {
    upload,
  };
};

export default useIpfs;
```

The basic functionality takes 3 lines of code:

- create a client with a gateway. There are different types of [gateway](https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/ipfs-gateway/#overview) for IFPS. For our example, we use a free one by infura.io, but you can use other services or create your own.
- Import a file or data into IPFS
- Get the path of the stored file

You can use this hook for storing anything you want on IPFS.

```jsx
const onSubmit: SubmitHandler<FormValues> = async (data) => {
  const image = data.image[0];

  /* upload an image */
  const imageUrl = await upload(image);

  /* upload a file */
  const fileUrl = await upload(data.file);

  /* upload a text */
  const textUrl = await upload("hello!");

  /* upload a JSON */
  const jsonUrl = await upload(
    JSON.stringify({
      title: "hellocurator",
      description: "Weâ€™re happy to introduce hellocurator",
    })
  );

  /* etc. */
};
```
