# Create a tilt effect with React

For this tutorial, we will create a tilt effect with React and Tailwind CSS.
A tilt effect is a visual effect that makes an element look like it is tilting when the user moves the mouse over it.
There are many ways to create a tilt effect, including using third-party libraries.
But I want to recreate the effect from scratch to understand how it works.

## The code

Here is the code to create what we have seen above.

```jsx
import { useState, MouseEvent, useCallback } from "react";

function throttle<T extends (...args: any[]) => any>(
  func: T,
  delay: number
): (...args: Parameters<T>) => void {
  let lastCall = 0;
  return (...args: Parameters<T>) => {
    const now = new Date().getTime();
    if (now - lastCall < delay) {
      return;
    }
    lastCall = now;
    return func(...args);
  };
}

export const TiltEffect = () => {
  const [rotate, setRotate] = useState({ x: 0, y: 0 });

  const onMouseMove = useCallback(
    throttle((e: MouseEvent<HTMLDivElement>) => {
      const card = e.currentTarget;
      const box = card.getBoundingClientRect();
      const x = e.clientX - box.left;
      const y = e.clientY - box.top;
      const centerX = box.width / 2;
      const centerY = box.height / 2;
      const rotateX = (y - centerY) / 7;
      const rotateY = (centerX - x) / 7;

      setRotate({ x: rotateX, y: rotateY });
    }, 100),
    []
  );

  const onMouseLeave = () => {
    setRotate({ x: 0, y: 0 });
  };

  return (
    <>
      <div
        className="card relative h-52 w-52 rounded-xl bg-white transition-[all_400ms_cubic-bezier(0.03,0.98,0.52,0.99)_0s] will-change-transform"
        onMouseMove={onMouseMove}
        onMouseLeave={onMouseLeave}
        style={{
          transform: `perspective(1000px) rotateX(${rotate.x}deg) rotateY(${rotate.y}deg) scale3d(1, 1, 1)`,
          transition: "all 400ms cubic-bezier(0.03, 0.98, 0.52, 0.99) 0s",
        }}
      >
        <div className="pulse absolute -inset-2 rounded-lg bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-600 via-purple-600 to-indigo-600 opacity-75 blur-xl" />
        <div className="relative flex h-full w-full select-none items-center justify-center rounded-lg bg-slate-900 text-sm font-light text-slate-300">
          hover me
        </div>
      </div>
    </>
  );
};
```

Let's break it down.

1. Throttle function

```ts
function throttle<T extends (...args: any[]) => any>(
  func: T,
  delay: number
): (...args: Parameters<T>) => void {
  let lastCall = 0;
  return (...args: Parameters<T>) => {
    const now = new Date().getTime();
    if (now - lastCall < delay) {
      return;
    }
    lastCall = now;
    return func(...args);
  };
}
```

This is a throttle function that limits the rate at which a function can fire. The throttle function takes a function (func) and a delay as arguments and returns a new function that, when invoked, will only call the func function at most once per every delay milliseconds.

2. `TiltEffect` component:

```jsx
export const TiltEffect = () => {
  const [rotate, setRotate] = useState({ x: 0, y: 0 });
  ...
};
```

This is the main component. It uses the useState hook to create a state variable rotate and its setter function setRotate. The rotate state is an object with x and y properties, which will be used to set the rotation of the element.

3. `onMouseMove` callback

```jsx
const onMouseMove = useCallback(
  throttle((e: MouseEvent<HTMLDivElement>) => {
    const card = e.currentTarget;
    const box = card.getBoundingClientRect();
    const x = e.clientX - box.left;
    const y = e.clientY - box.top;
    const centerX = box.width / 2;
    const centerY = box.height / 2;
    const rotateX = (y - centerY) / 10;
    const rotateY = (centerX - x) / 10;

    setRotate({ x: rotateX, y: rotateY });
  }, 100),
  []
);
```

This is a callback function that is called when the mouse moves over the element. It calculates the rotation values based on the mouse position and sets the rotate state. The `useCallback` hook is used to memoize the function, and the `throttle` function is used to limit how often this function can be called.

4. `onMouseLeave`

```jsx
const onMouseLeave = () => {
  setRotate({ x: 0, y: 0 });
};
```

This is a simple function that resets the rotate state when the mouse leaves the element.

5. Rendering the component

```jsx
return (
  <>
    <div
      className="card relative h-52 w-52 rounded-xl bg-white transition-[all_400ms_cubic-bezier(0.03,0.98,0.52,0.99)_0s] will-change-transform"
      onMouseMove={onMouseMove}
      onMouseLeave={onMouseLeave}
      style={{
        transform: `perspective(1000px) rotateX(${rotate.x}deg) rotateY(${rotate.y}deg) scale3d(1, 1, 1)`,
        transition: "all 400ms cubic-bezier(0.03, 0.98, 0.52, 0.99) 0s",
      }}
    >
      <div className="pulse absolute -inset-2 rounded-lg bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-600 via-purple-600 to-indigo-600 opacity-75 blur-xl" />
      <div className="relative flex h-full w-full select-none items-center justify-center rounded-lg bg-slate-900 text-sm font-light text-slate-300">
        hover me
      </div>
    </div>
  </>
);
```

This is the JSX that gets rendered by the component. It's a div element with some Tailwind CSS classes and styles applied to it. The onMouseMove and onMouseLeave callbacks are attached to this div.

We use the transform property to applies 3D transformation to the card.
In our case, we applied a rotation transformation to the card:

- `rotateX(${rotate.x}deg) rotateY(${rotate.y}deg)`: These functions rotate the element around the X-axis and Y-axis, respectively. The rotation angles are determined by the rotate state, which is updated when the mouse moves over the element.

In summary, this component creates a simple "tilt effect" where an element rotates based on the position of the mouse cursor over it. The rotation is limited by a throttle function to improve performance.
