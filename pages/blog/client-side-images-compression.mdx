Optimizing images on the web is a common thing. For [hellocurator](https://www.hellocurator.xyz/), we want to optimize images before the upload, we can do it without servers, on the client-side.

The [Canvas element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API) let manipulate images with Javascript quite easily.
We can found a lot of [code examples](https://gist.github.com/1isten/0ec8c0bc78171c38a3d8b3cf48430a41) about how to compress image with the Canvas API.

I will use [compressorjs](https://github.com/fengyuanchen/compressorjs), a tiny librarie ([3.8 kB minzipped](https://bundlephobia.com/package/compressorjs@1.1.1)).
Compressor.js uses the Browser's native `HTMLCanvasElement.toBlob()` API to do the compression work, which means it is lossy compression.

There's a [live Demo](https://fengyuanchen.github.io/compressorjs/) to play with it.

## The code

In some case, I like to wrap dependencies in my projects.
So the code looks like:

```JSX
import Compressor from "compressorjs";

export const compress = async (
  file: File,
  quality: number,
  maxHeight: number,
  maxWidth: number,
  convertSize?: number
): Promise<File | Blob> => {
  return await new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    new Compressor(file, {
      quality,
      maxHeight,
      maxWidth,
      convertSize,
      success: resolve,
      error: reject,
    });
  });
};
```

You can use more options, as provided in the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/fengyuanchen/compressorjs#options).

And, to use it

```JSX
const upload async = (data) => {
  const file = data.image[0];
  const compressedFile = await compress(file, 0.6, 2000, 2000, 1000);
  const imageUploaded = await upload(compressedFile);
  ...
}
```
