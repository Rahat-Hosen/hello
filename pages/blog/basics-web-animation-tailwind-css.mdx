# Basic of web animations with Tailwind CSS

Animations on websites serve a purpose: they can draw attention and highlight important elements. Transitioning from plain CSS to Tailwind CSS for animations might initially feel different. That's how I felt too, preferring the classic vanilla CSS way.

However, Tailwind CSS offers its own unique methods, and they can simplify the animation process when you become accustomed to them.

In this blog post, I won’t go into all properties related to animations; I highly recommend checking out the [MDN documentation on CSS animation](https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/CSS/animation) for a comprehensive understanding. Instead, we will focus on some basic examples of animations built with Tailwind CSS and explain how they work.

All code examples are basics so you can easily adapt them to your needs.

## Fade in

The fade-in effect is a classic yet powerful tool for drawing attention to elements as they enter the screen.

### Showcase

<ComponentPlayground hasDarkMode className="group">
  <FadeIn />
</ComponentPlayground>

_Hover (or touch on mobile) the card to see the animation._

```ts tailwind.config.ts
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      animation: {
        "fade-in": "fade-in 0.9s ease-in",
      },
      keyframes: {
        "fade-in": {
          "0%": {
            opacity: "0",
          },
          "100%": {
            opacity: "1",
          },
        },
      },
    },
  },
};
```

We have to customize the `tailwind.config.ts` file to add our [animation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/animation#customizing-your-theme).

### Where to use

Fade-ins are excellent for gracefully introducing elements like additional information, images, or promotional content. They ensure that content doesn’t abruptly appear, offering a polished user experience.

## Slide in

Slide-in animations are essential for a dynamic and interactive UI, making content transition into view smoothly.

<ComponentPlayground hasDarkMode className="overflow-hidden">
  <SlideIn />
</ComponentPlayground>

```tsx slide-in.tsx
export const SlideIn = () => {
  return (
    <div className="h-32 w-52 translate-y-1/2 transform rounded-xl bg-neutral-500 transition-transform duration-500 ease-in-out hover:translate-y-0">
      <img
        src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1694684677360-5cb0841ec36e?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=crop&fm=jpg&h=108&ixid=MnwxfDB8MXxyYW5kb218MHx8fHx8fHx8MTY5NTgwNjYxNA&ixlib=rb-4.0.3&q=80&w=208"
        className="h-full w-full rounded-xl object-cover"
      />
    </div>
  );
};
```

We can also use `className` only for some basic animations.

### Where to Use

Employ slide-in animations to unveil new content, navigation menus, or elements that shouldn’t be immediately visible. It keeps the UI clean and reveals additional content interactively.

## Rotate

Rotating animations can turn static UIs into dynamic, interactive environments.

<ComponentPlayground hasDarkMode>
  <Rotate />
</ComponentPlayground>

```ts tailwind.config.ts
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      animation: {
        "rotate-360": "rotate-360 1s linear",
      },
      keyframes: {
        "rotate-360": {
          "0%": {
            transform: "rotate(0deg)",
          },
          "100%": {
            transform: "rotate(360deg)",
          },
        },
      },
    },
  },
};
```

### Where to use

Use rotate animations for interactive elements like refresh icons or loading indicators. They’re also great for adding a playful touch to clickable elements, signaling interactivity.

## Scale

Scaling animations can breathe life into your UI, making buttons and other elements feel engaging.

<ComponentPlayground>
  <Scale />
</ComponentPlayground>

```tsx scale.tsx
export const Scale = () => {
  return (
    <button className="scale-100 rounded-2xl bg-neutral-800 px-2 py-1 text-neutral-50 transition-transform duration-500 hover:scale-125">
      Hover me
    </button>
  );
};
```

### Where to use

Scale animation is a great way to add a playful touch to your UI. Use it for buttons, icons, and other elements that should feel interactive. It’s also a great way to signal that an element is clickable.

## Conclusion

In this article, we've scratched the surface, focusing on some foundational animations to get you started. To improve your animations skills, I recommend you to play around, mix different styles, and observe how they enhance the user interface.

Tailwind CSS is cool for its ability to offer quick and efficient ways to implement animations using just class names. However, for more complex and tailored animations, customizing the `tailwind.config.ts` is necessary. It grants you the flexibility to define and control animations at a granular level, ensuring that the animations align perfectly with your requirements.

If you want more, I’ve curated a collection of animations in a special project. It’s a gallery that showcases a lots of Tailwind CSS animations. Visit [animation.ibelick.com](https://animation.ibelick.com/) to explore it, find inspiration, or pick up ready-to-use codes for your next project.
