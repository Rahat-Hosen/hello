# Creating an encrypted text effect with React

In my series of posts about creating text effects with React, I've already covered [creating a text reveal effect](/blog/create-text-reveal-effect-with-tailwind-css/) and [creating a text sliding effect](/blog/create-text-sliding-effect-with-tailwind-css/).

In this post, I'll show you how to create this encrypted text effect:

<ComponentPlayground hasReTrigger>
  <TextEncrypted text="Hello friends!" interval={60} />
</ComponentPlayground>
